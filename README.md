# Digicrome-Final-Capstone-Project

About the Project

This project is the Final of my capstone work. It focuses on analyzing text reviews and predicting sentiment using Python.
The notebook shows how I cleaned the data, explored it, and built a model to understand customer feedback.

Goals
Clean and prepare the data
Find patterns and trends in reviews
Build a model to predict sentiment
Check how well the model performs

 Tools and Libraries
Python
Pandas and NumPy – data handling
Matplotlib and Seaborn – visualizations
NLTK / VADER – text sentiment analysis
Scikit-learn – machine learning
TensorFlow / Keras – deep learning (if used)

 Steps in the Notebook
Load the dataset
Clean and preprocess the text
Visualize words and trends
Create new features (like sentiment score, word count)
Build and train sentiment models
Test and check accuracy

Key Insights
Positive reviews are short and simple
Negative reviews are longer and detailed
Words like great, recommended show positive feedback
Words like bad, disappointing show negative feedback

 How to Run
